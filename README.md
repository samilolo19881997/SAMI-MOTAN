Epidemiology of Taenia saginata Global, Regional, and Local Perspectives (Palestine).
Why Focus on Taenia saginata ? In the last 6 years (after 2018 AD) and during inspections in slaughterhouses, we noticed the new cases of this disease in beef (Bovine cysticercosis) after it had not been present for years(Why?), which is considered an indicator of the increased prevalence of this disease in the future. There is no Surveillance system and Screening in Palestine to follow up this disease, so it is possible that there are infected cases but they are not tested. this disease is silent for a long period of time extending for years before the symptoms begin to appear, or it may be asymptomatic and result in other health complications that threaten the patient's life. 
Prevalence :Taenia saginata is worldwide in distribution. We will discuss it on: Global. Regional (Middle East and North Africa). local (Palestine).
Globally: Taenia saginata is considered the most common zoonotic tapeworm, with an estimated 60–70 million carriers globally , particularly found in areas where beef consumption is common and sanitation inadequate.  The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies taeniasis, the intestinal infection caused by Taenia species, as prevalent in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia . The World Organization for animal health (WOAH) reports concerning T. saginata taeniasis and bovine cysticercosis globally, regional, locally.
Regional Prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA):A total of 63 publications were retrieved across the 21 MENA countries. Taenia saginata reported in 11 of these countries. prevalence values ranged between 0.02–8.6% .Bovine cysticercosis prevalence (based on meat inspection) only reported for Egypt and Israel between 0.2–20% and 0.1–9.1%  respectively .
Locally : Two patients registrated only in Palestinian health services in the West bank 2008-2017, the first from Hebron and the second from Ramallah. The average annual incidence rate was found for taenia saginata (0.01 cases/100,000 inhabitants in the West Bank) [7]  . Bovine cysticercosis prevalence (based on meat inspection) estimated .05 - .18 % .

Management: Prevention: 1- Meat Inspection: Judgment of a carcass in slaughterhouse, If cardiac and/or masseter muscles  contains Cysticerci  : At least one cyst : Store in the freezer at ( -17 C ) degrees for 14 days, More than 3 cyst : Total condemnation the carcass, destroying it  in a special container . 2- Food Safety and Hygiene: Ensure beef is cooked to a temperature of at least 63°C (145°F) to kill tapeworm larvae.              
 3-Environmental and Sanitation Improvements: Personal hygiene , Proper disposal of human waste.  4- Regular Monitoring:Enhance surveillance and reporting of parasitic infections.  5- Health Education: Educate communities about the risks of consuming undercooked meat . 6- Anthelminthic for Cattle: Albendazole drug of choice.
Recommendations: 1- Holding conferences and meetings for all relevant ministries, such as health, agriculture, and statistics, as well as the Institute of Public Health at Birzeit University and municipalities, in order to plan and establish a disease monitoring system and implement research studies of related diseases also to improve the level of public health and early detection of diseases through screening. 2-Education programs for community (as school students, housewives, .. ) about the risks of consuming undercooked beef and the importance of proper meat handling. 3- Although cases of T. saginata infection in Palestine appear to be rare, there may be unscreened (subclinical) cases, hence the urgent need for proactive public health measures to prevent potential outbreaks and effectively manage this zoonotic threat. 4- Submitting recommendations to local authorities on the importance of establishing  slaughterhouses (most West Bank cities lack slaughterhouses) .
